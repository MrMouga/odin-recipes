    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>50g dried porcini mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 vegetable stock cube</li> 
        <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>250g pack chestnut mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>300g risotto rice, such as arborio</li> 
        <li>1 x 175ml glass white wine</li>
        <li>25g butter</li>
        <li>handful parsley leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>50g parmesan or Grana Padano, freshly grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>STEP 1</strong>
            <br>Put 50g dried porcini mushrooms into a large bowl and pour over 1 litre boiling water. 
            <br>Soak for 20 mins, then drain into a bowl, discarding the last few tbsp of liquid left in the bowl.</li>

        <li><strong>STEP 2</strong>
            <br>Crumble 1 vegetable stock cube into the mushroom liquid, then squeeze the mushrooms gently to remove any liquid.</li>

        <li><strong>STEP 3</strong>
            <br>Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a shallow saucepan or deep frying pan over a medium flame.
            <br> Add 1 finely chopped onion and 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, then fry for about 5 mins until soft.</li>

        <li><strong>STEP 4</strong>
            <br>Stir in 250g chopped chestnut mushrooms and the dried mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and continue to cook for 8 mins until the fresh mushrooms have softened.</li>

        <li><strong>STEP 5</strong>
            <br>Tip 300g risotto rice into the pan and cook for 1 min. 
            <br>Pour over a 175ml glass of white wine and let it bubble to nothing so the alcohol evaporates.</li>

        <li><strong>STEP 6</strong>
            <br>Keep the pan over a medium heat and pour in a quarter of the mushroom stock. 
            <br>Simmer the rice, stirring often, until the rice has absorbed all the liquid.</li>

        <li><strong>STEP 7</strong>
            <br>Add about the same amount of stock again and continue to simmer and stir - it should start to become creamy, plump and tender. 
            <br>By the time the final quarter of stock is added, the rice should be almost cooked.</li>

        <li><strong>STEP 8</strong>
            <br>Continue stirring until the rice is cooked. 
            <br>If the rice is still undercooked, add a splash of water. 
            <br>Take the pan off the heat, add 25g butter and scatter over 25g grated parmesan or Grana Padano cheese and half a handful of chopped parsley leaves.</li>

        <li><strong>STEP 9</strong>
            <br>Cover and leave for a few mins so that the rice can take up any excess liquid as it cools a bit. 
            <br>Give the risotto a final stir, spoon into bowls and scatter with the remaining 25g grated cheese and the remaining chopped parsley leaves.</li>
        
    </ol>
