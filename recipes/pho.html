    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This delicious homemade pho recipe is inspired by the Vietnamese soup we all know and love, 
    <br>yet made with a few time-saving shortcuts!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>

            <strong>Steak:</strong> Pho bo is traditionally made with thinly sliced steak that is cooked in the simmering broth in each individual serving bowl. 
            <br>In order to very thinly slice the steak, I recommend popping the steak in the freezer for about 45-60 minutes, then slicing it against the grain as thinly as possible. 
            <br>(Alternately, you can ask the butcher to thinly slice your steak for you, or add pre-cooked steak to your soup.)
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Thin rice noodles:</strong> Pho is traditionally made with thin rice noodles, such as these. 
            <br>In order to prevent the noodles from overcooking in the broth, it’s traditional to cook pho noodles separately on their own. 
            <br>Then the noodles will be added to each individual serving bowl, followed by the protein, hot broth and toppings.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong> Pho broth</strong> Again, this “shortcut” version of pho broth would not be considered authentic.
            <br> But it is a delicious and faster alternative to making it 100% from scratch, and it uses the following elements:
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        <strong>Fresh onions and ginger:</strong> Which we will briefly cook in a skillet (or you can pop them under the broiler in your oven) until charred, in order to add that classic smoky flavor to the broth.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Beef stock</strong>: In order to save the extra hours required to cook beef stock from scratch, I’ve written this recipe using (good quality) store-bought stock as a shortcut. 
                        <br>(That said, if you would like to make a more authentic pho recipe using homemade beef stock, I recommend trying this recipe.)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Spices:</strong> There are 5 important spices in pho broth — star anise, whole cloves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and coriander seeds. I really recommend using the whole (not ground) spices if possible, which we will briefly toast to bring out extra flavor. But I have also included notes below for using ground spices, if those are what you have on hand.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Fish sauce:</strong> It’s traditional to add just a little splash to the broth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sweetener:</strong> I used brown sugar to sweeten my broth instead of traditional yellow rock sugar, but really, any sweetener you prefer will work.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Sea salt:</strong> As always, to season your broth.
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </li>
 </ul>

    <h3>HOW TO MAKE PHO SOUP:</h3>
    <p>
        Here is the basic overview for how to make homemade pho bowls! (As always, see the recipe below for the full detailed instructions.)
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the protein.</strong>
            <br> In order to slice the beef, chicken or pork as thinly as possible, I recommend popping the meat in the freezer for at least 30-45 minutes to chill.  
            <br>Then use a sharp knife to thinly slice the meat before adding it to the soup.</li>

        <li><strong>Make the broth.</strong>
            <br>Meanwhile, as the meat is chilling, char the onion and ginger (either in a skillet or under the broiler). 
            <br> Meanwhile, briefly toast the spices in a large stockpot. 
            <br>Then add in the onion, ginger, and broth. 
            <br>Cover and let everything simmer together for at least 30 minutes so that all of those flavors can meld. 
            <br>Strain out and discard all of the onions, ginger and spices. 
            <br>Then stir in the remaining ingredients and season with salt.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prep the noodles.</strong>
            <br>Meanwhile, as your broth is simmering, go ahead and cook the noodles al dente according to the package instructions. 
            <br>Drain in a strainer, then toss briefly with cold water to prevent the noodles from continuing to cook, and set aside. 
            <br>(I also recommend tossing the noodles with a drizzle of oil — such as sesame oil — to prevent them from sticking.)
        </li>

        <li><strong>Assemble. </strong>
            <br>Once everything is ready to go, add a handful of noodles to each individual serving bowl, topped with your desired protein. 
            <br>Then ladle the simmering hot broth into the serving bowls, being sure to submerge the meat so that it will get cooked. 
            <br>Top with lots and lots of garnishes.</li>

        <li><strong>Serve. </strong>
            <br> And serve warm, encouraging everyone to stir the garnishes into the soup so that they can flavor the broth, also adding in additional extra sauces if desired. 
        </li>   
    </ol>
